            "Well, good afternoon, everybody. It is 1 o'clock on Tuesday, October 14th, and I will call to order this special called meeting of the City of Austin City Council Audit and Finance Committee. We are meeting in City Council chambers located in City Hall at 301 West 2nd Street in Austin, Texas, and we have a quorum of the committee present. We don't have anybody signed up to speak, right? No, we do not. All right, very good. So the item that we have is an executive session item. We are in the process of appointing a new city auditor, and so we're in the process of doing that so that we have personnel matters, and so we will go into an executive session to discuss personnel issues related to the appointment of a new city auditor pursuant to Section 551.074 of the Texas Government Code, which addresses personnel matters. Without objection, we will go into that executive session, and there's no objection, so we'll go into executive session at 1.01 p.m. We're going to have to sync these clocks. I'm going to consider that to be the official clock for right now. For anybody paying attention to this, when we finish the executive session, we will have no other business, and I will come back in and adjourn the Audit and Finance Committee. Thank you all. Good afternoon. It is 3.06 p.m. on Tuesday, October 14th. The Audit and Finance Committee of the Austin City Council has been meeting in executive session to discuss one item. That's item number one, personnel issues related to the appointment of a new city auditor. Those are personnel matters that allowed us to go into executive session pursuant to Section 551.074 of the Texas Government Code. There's no further business to come before the Audit and Finance Committee of the Austin City Council. So without objection, the Audit and Finance Committee is adjourned from this special called meeting at 3.06 p.m. Thanks, everybody. Thank you.\n",
